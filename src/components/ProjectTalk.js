          <p>
            This is my first full-stack project that is meaningful and
            impactful. This is an ongoing project and is non-open source. I've
            learned many things along the way even though we had just started
            building this project a couple of months ago. My interest in data
            science and artificial intelligence led me to pursue this project
            idea with my team. The project is designed to clean, prepare,
            display and visualize unstructured and structured data for data
            analysis and machine learning. There are multiple software options
            out there that perform similarily, but for this project, we are
            hoping to build new features that my team and I are going to bring
            forth to further enhance user experiences and hoping to further
            achieve users' goals.
